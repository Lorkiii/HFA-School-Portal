# Hostinger Deployment Tutorial - Complete Guide

## üìã What You'll Need Before Starting

- [ ] Hostinger account (sign up at hostinger.com)
- [ ] Business or Premium hosting plan (includes Node.js support)
- [ ] Your Firebase `serviceAccountKey.json` file
- [ ] Gmail account with App Password ready
- [ ] Your project files

**Time needed:** About 30-45 minutes

---

## Part 1: Prepare Your Application (DO THIS FIRST!)

### Step 1: Create Your .env File

1. In your project folder, create a new file named `.env` (exactly like that, starting with a dot)
2. Copy this template and fill in YOUR details:

```env
JWT_SECRET=CHANGE_THIS_TO_A_LONG_RANDOM_STRING_MIN_32_CHARACTERS
SMTP_USER=your-school-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password-here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**How to fill each field:**

**JWT_SECRET:** 
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Run this command:
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
- Copy the output and paste as JWT_SECRET value

**SMTP_USER:** Your Gmail address (e.g., `holyfamilyacademy@gmail.com`)

**SMTP_PASS:** Gmail App Password (NOT your regular password!)
- Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Sign in to your Google account
- Create a new App Password for "Mail"
- Copy the 16-character password
- Paste it in SMTP_PASS (no spaces)

### Step 2: Get Your Firebase Credentials

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Project Settings
4. Go to "Service Accounts" tab
5. Click "Generate New Private Key"
6. Save the file as `serviceAccountKey.json`
7. **IMPORTANT:** This file should be in your `server/` folder

### Step 3: Update CORS for Production

Open `server/server.mjs` and find lines 84-89. You'll update this AFTER you get your domain.

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: [
      "https://your-actual-domain.com",  // ‚Üê You'll add this later
      "https://www.your-actual-domain.com",  // ‚Üê And this
      "http://127.0.0.1:5500", // Keep for local testing
      "http://localhost:3000"  // Keep for local testing
    ],
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

## Part 2: Set Up Hostinger Account

### Step 4: Purchase Hosting Plan

1. Go to https://www.hostinger.com
2. Click "Hosting" ‚Üí "Premium Web Hosting" or "Business Web Hosting"
   - **Important:** You NEED Business plan or higher for Node.js support

   - Or select "I'll use my existing domain"
5. Complete payment

### Step 5: Access Your Control Panel

1. After purchase, check your email for login details
2. Go to https://hpanel.hostinger.com
3. Log in with your credentials

## Part 3: Upload Your Files

### Step 6: Prepare Files for Upload

**DO NOT upload these folders/files:**
- ‚ùå `node_modules/` folder (too large, will install on server)
- ‚ùå `.git/` folder (not needed)
- ‚ùå `.env` file (we'll set these separately)
- ‚ùå Any local test files

**DO upload everything else:**
- ‚úÖ All your project folders (adminportal, server, login, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- ‚úÖ All HTML, CSS, JS files
- ‚úÖ `assets/` folder
- ‚úÖ `serviceAccountKey.json` (inside server folder)

### Step 7: Upload via File Manager

1. In Hostinger panel, click **"File Manager"**
2. Navigate to `public_html/` folder (this is your website root)
3. Delete the default `index.html` if present
4. Click **"Upload Files"** button (top right)
5. Select ALL your project files and folders
6. Wait for upload to complete (may take 5-10 minutes)

**Folder Structure on Server should look like:**
```
public_html/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adminportal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ applicationform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.mjs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ serviceAccountKey.json  ‚Üê MUST be here!
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teacher-application/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... other files
```
