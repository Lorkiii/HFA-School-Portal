## 🔍 **Querying Activity Logs**

### **Find all enrollment changes:**
```javascript
db.collection('activity_logs')
  .where('action', 'in', [
    'update-enrollment-settings',
    'start-enrollment',
    'close-enrollment'
  ])
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .get();
```

### **Find enrollment changes by specific admin:**
```javascript
db.collection('activity_logs')
  .where('actorUid', '==', 'admin-uid')
  .where('action', '==', 'start-enrollment')
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .get();
```

### **Find recent enrollment changes (last 30 days):**
```javascript
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);

db.collection('activity_logs')
  .where('action', 'in', ['start-enrollment', 'close-enrollment'])
  .where('timestamp', '>=', thirtyDaysAgo)
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .get();
```

## 🎓 **For Defense Panel**

**Q: "How do you ensure accountability for enrollment period changes?"**

**A:**
> "We maintain a complete audit trail using the `activity_logs` collection. Every enrollment operation is logged with:
> - The admin who made the change (UID, email, display name)
> - Exact timestamp of the change
> - Which level was affected (JHS/SHS)
> - The specific dates set or action taken
> 
> These logs are **immutable** - they cannot be edited or deleted, even by admins. This ensures complete accountability and provides a clear audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting."
